3. *Summary:* 
   I am a completely new person in IT, and in this I see my strength and weakness at the same time.
   I studied Chinese language and culture in the Czech Republic (Brno) and completed additional training in the United Kingdom (Cambridge) related to the installation of offshore wind turbines, and thanks to this I have a wide multicultural experience of communicating and working together with people from different cultural backgrounds. Easily understand people's expectations and desires. In colleagues, I value attention to detail and a deep understanding of the processes.
   At the moment, I strive to become a valuable specialist in the front-end and hope for mutually beneficial support from the company and colleagues.
   P.S. In the nearest future, I want to contribute to the development of green energy in the Eastern European region, and thus use all my accumulated knowledge and skills.
